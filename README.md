# Feature Engineering Project: Extraction and Selection in Bi-Dimensional Data

## Overview

This project focuses on the crucial data preparation and feature engineering phases within predictive modeling. We aim to enhance machine learning model performance through effective feature extraction, transformation, and selection, especially from high-dimensionality data.

## Objectives

1. **Data Reading and Preparation:** Import and organize raw datasets from various sources for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilize statistics and visualizations to understand data characteristics and distributions.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Develop new features using domain knowledge and insights from data analysis.
4. **Feature Transformation and Selection:** Apply methods to modify and select the most relevant features to optimize model performance.
5. **Modeling and Evaluation:** Train models like RandomForestRegressor, SVR, and Lasso to predict outcomes accurately.
6. **Feature Importance and Optimization:** Analyze feature importance and refine the feature set using techniques such as ReliefF.
7. **Conclusion and Future Work:** Summarize findings and discuss future directions for research in this area.
